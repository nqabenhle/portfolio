                <p>As a dedicated student from South Africa, I am pursuing a degree in Economics, while also expanding my knowledge in Computer Science. To improve my programming skills, I have been taking online courses and dedicating every spare moment to self-teaching. I started learning how to program with CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course in February 2022, and have since developed a strong foundation in computational thinking, abstraction, data structures, algorithms, web development, and software engineering.</p>
                <p>Over the past 6 months, I have focused on developing my programming skills by building web applications capable of handling large sets of data. My expertise lies in creating high-quality, responsive, and mobile-friendly websites using HTML, CSS (including SASS), JavaScript, and Bootstrap on the front end. On the back end, I utilize Python with the Django Framework to ensure the efficient and effective management of websiteÂ functionality.</p>
