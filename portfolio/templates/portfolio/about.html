                <p>I am a hard-working and dedicated student from South Africa. I study Economics but I take Computer Science courses online and teach myself programming for every second I get. I started learning how to program by the end of February 2022. I began with the CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course. In the past few months, I have learned computational thinking, abstraction, data structures, algorithms, web development, and how to be a better programmer.</p>
                <p>I have been developing projects for the last 6 months and I specialize in creating powerful web applications capable of handling a large set of data. I can create responsive, mobile-friendly, and high-quality websites using HTML, CSS (SASS), JavaScript, and Bootstrap on the front end. On the back end, I use Python with the Django Framework. </p>
